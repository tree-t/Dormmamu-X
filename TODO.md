# This file is here to remind me to what features/fixes I wish to add to  S.L.U.X .
if a new TODO goal is added, but the previous ones are still pending, then the date of addition of those TODO object in the TODO file can be mentioned.
For example: if lets say 'add sudo' was added on 21/3/2022, but on 22/3/2022, another object is to be proposed, then it can be written as:
(
(22/3/2022)

2. object
)
Once an object/goal is completed, it will be manually hashtaged.Example:(#2. object)
# List 1(as of 21/3/2022)
- #1. Add sudo
