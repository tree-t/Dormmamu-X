S.L.U.X. - `Small Live Unsupported Linux`
(The name is subject to change [that is, it may turn to `Small Live Unbloated Linux`])

A small distro derived from source code of S.L.A.X.(based on debian).

Preface:

The idea of S.L.U.X. struck me, when Tomas Matejicek(founder of Slax), suddenly stopped to update Slax,
at that time I created a small version of SLUX, but it failed to boot.
Hence, I started searching, why it wasn't booting, but then I stopped, as Tomas started to update Slax.
But this time I had issues like connman wouldn't work, hence I have started an os called SLUX, if you have suggestions related to anything here, you are free to create an issue and if you wish, then you can also create a pull request (mostly it will be merged it found to be useful).
(I know that I don't have good writing skills, but if you do, then please help me with the readme and other things[not by raising money, but by raising an issue).
:)
