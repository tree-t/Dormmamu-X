The name is subject to change (that is, it may turn to `Small Live Unbloated Linux`)

<h1> Introduction</h1>
<p>S.L.U.X. is a small distro derived from source code of S.L.A.X.(based on debian).
The small size of its 01-core.sb(base system is due to the fact that it is debootstrapped and not a debian net install(for the difference see ).
